# pyrbtree

## Description

This package provides an implementation of a tree
based set and mapping. For performance reasons, it
uses an underlying binary extension wrapping a C
library: CRBTree.

## Installation

### From PyPI

    pip install pyrbtree

### From Github

This is the recommended way if you want to contribute or simply tweak
`pyrbtree` to your own requirements. You can get a local copy by
downloading a zipfile but if you want to make changes, you should
 rather clone the repository to have access to all `git` goodies:

    git clone https://github.com/s-ball/pyrbtree.git

You can then install it in your main Python installation or in a venv with:

    pip install -e .

or on Windows with the launcher:

    py -m pip install -e .
    

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome, including issues on GitHub.
Problems are expected to be documented so that they can be reproduced. But
I only develop this on my free time, so I cannot guarantee quick answers...

## Disclaimer: alpha quality
